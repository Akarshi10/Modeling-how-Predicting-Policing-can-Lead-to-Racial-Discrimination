# Modeling-how-Predicting-Policing-can-Lead-to-Racial-Discrimination

 The study focuses on plotting crime incidents on the Baltimore map, generating heat maps based on the density of crimes, applying Kernel Density Estimation on the incident coordinates and predicting the future possible events and understanding the race and gender distribution among the neighborhoods to possibly establish the fairness in the algorithm. Also, other factors like Food Deserts, Transportation are visualized on the maps to understand the racial bias and connection to the crime occurrences.
